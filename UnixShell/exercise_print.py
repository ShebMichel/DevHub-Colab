## example 1
## The objective of this exercise is to understand how to print and output
# 1- Let define two variable a and b 
a=5
b=1000
# 2- Let add a and b and assign a new variable to the result such as c=a+b
c = a+b 
# 3- Let now print the results of c in multiple forms
print(" The 1 result of a+b = ",c)
print(" The 2 result of a+b = ",a+b)
print(f" The 3 result of {a}+{b} = {c}")
print(f" The 4 result of {a}+{b} = " + str(c) )
print(' The 4 result of a+b = '+ str(c) )
