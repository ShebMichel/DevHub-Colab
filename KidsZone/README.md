This repo contain kids materials for coding.


Tips for Success

1- Use Visual Feedback: Libraries like turtle or pygame make coding interactive and visual.

2- Encourage Creativity: Let them modify exercises to make their own unique versions.

3- Gamify Learning: Challenge them to "level up" by solving slightly harder tasks.

4- Focus on Fun: Keep the pace slow and let them explore without pressure.

5- Code Together: Solve problems with them, explaining concepts along the way.
