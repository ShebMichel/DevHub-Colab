Location Input: Users can manually enter their location to set the search starting point.

Distance Selection: A distance filter allows users to define the search radius (e.g., 5 km, 10 km, 20 km) to refine results.

Interactive Map Integration: Results can be displayed on an interactive map for better visualization.

Real-Time Data Fetching: The app fetches real-time fuel price data and station availability where applicable.

Sorting & Filtering Options: Users can sort stations by price, distance, or availability.
